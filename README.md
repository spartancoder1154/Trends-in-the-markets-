This SQL script analyzes key metrics from a startups database, providing insights into company valuations, funding, categories, and locations. It starts by exploring the structure of the table and calculating foundational statistics such as the total number of startups, total valuation, and highest amount raised. The queries then dive deeper to evaluate funding by stage (e.g., Seed), identify the oldest startup, and compute average valuations across categoriesâ€”both raw and rounded values, ordered from highest to lowest. The script also investigates market competitiveness by counting the number of companies per category and highlighting those with more than three entries. Lastly, it compares startup sizes by location, including a filtered view for locations with larger average team sizes. This analysis offers a comprehensive overview for anyone researching startup trends or exploring investment opportunities.
